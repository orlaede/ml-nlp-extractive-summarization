# **Extractive Summarization Using TextRank** #

This project show a method for text summarization with extractive approach using text rank algorithm. The dataset we will use in this work will be the Multi News dataset, which consists of a series of news articles from the website newser.com. 

The summaries present in the dataset were written by professional writers by editors and include links to the original articles. As the object is an extractive summarization, we will extract the texts of the articles and leave the presented summaries aside, so we have a new dataest with the original texts of the articles.
